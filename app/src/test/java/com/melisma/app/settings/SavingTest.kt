 * Which power-saving measures are in force.
 *
 * Worth testing away from a phone because the failures are invisible from the inside: a measure
 * applied when the phone is not saving is a feature quietly switched off for everybody, and one
 * that never applies is a setting that does nothing. Neither looks like a bug — it just looks like
 * the app.
