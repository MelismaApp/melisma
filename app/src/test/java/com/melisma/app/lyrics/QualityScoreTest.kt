/**
 * Which of several answers to show.
 *
 * The rule used to be the document's `kind` and nothing else, and `kind` is set from *any* word timing
 * at all — so a source with word timings on three lines out of forty was scored as the best thing
 * available and beat a complete line-synced transcription outright. Same for a source that matched the
 * wrong recording and returned a tenth of the words with perfect timings.
 *
 * The property to keep while fixing that: a genuine word-timed answer still beats every line-timed
 * one. Only an answer that is not word-timed *for this song* — barely any lines timed, or barely any
 * of the song present — drops to where completeness decides.
