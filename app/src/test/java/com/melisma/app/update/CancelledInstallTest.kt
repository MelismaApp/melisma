/**
 * Cancelling Android's install screen.
 *
 * Reported as "the update dialogue stays there forever and you cannot back out of it. You can't
 * restart the update. Just stuck there." Both halves were true, and the cause is that Android tells
 * an app *nothing* when the user dismisses its install confirmation: the app is simply left in the
 * state it was in when it handed the file over. That state offered no buttons and ignored the back
 * gesture, because it was treated as work in progress rather than as a question.
 *
 * It survived release because the successful path never shows it — a completed install replaces the
 * process, so the only way to see this state again is to *not* install.
