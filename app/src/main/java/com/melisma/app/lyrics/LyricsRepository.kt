 * Which providers to ask for a track, in the order the user put them in.

 *    file the user imported outranks every network source by definition.
 * 2. A provider missing its token is dropped rather than queried, so leaving one enabled
 *    while you go and find the token costs nothing.
 * 3. A cache server takes its place in the order like any other source, so it can be ranked and
 *    switched off from the same list — it used to be prepended unconditionally, which made its
 *    priority a hidden special case nobody could see or change. It still only counts when the
 *    developer options are on and a URL is set, and [CacheServerMode.ONLY] still overrides
 *    everything, because "ask only the server" is a different question from "ask it first".
 *
 * Free of the repository's state so it can be tested directly: which sources a given
 * settings object will actually hit is exactly the sort of thing that is easy to get
 * subtly wrong and impossible to notice.
 */
/**
 * Which answer to show, out of everything the sources came back with.
 *
 * Four questions, in this order, and the order of them is the whole design:
 *
 * 1. **What kind of timings does it have?** Word-by-word beats line-by-line beats none. This is the
 *    difference between karaoke and a teleprompter, and no preference outranks it.
 * 2. **Is it most of the song, or a scrap of it?** A source with a tenth of the words another one
 *    found is truncated or is the wrong recording. That is a broken answer rather than a matter of
 *    taste, so it loses however highly it is ranked.
 * 3. **Where did the user put it?** Earlier in *Where lyrics come from* wins. Twenty lines against
 *    twenty-one is what a preference is *for*.
 * 4. **How complete exactly, and does it bring its own romanization?** Only as a last resort, between
 *    sources the user never expressed an opinion about.
 *
 * Reported as "Musixmatch is at the bottom of the list and still wins — is the list reversed?" It was
 * not reversed. It was barely consulted: the score used to be one number combining the tier with
 * completeness and extras, so the user's order only broke an *exact* tie between two totals, and the
 * fourteen points of completeness and extras almost always broke it first. A source at the bottom of
 * the list won every time it happened to have a few more lines than the others.
 *
 * Worse than useless, in fact: the fullest answer *sets* the yardstick the others are measured
 * against, so a source returning mangled, duplicated lines inflated the line count, then won the
 * completeness it had just defined. Ranking it last did nothing.
 *
 * Completeness still matters where it should. A document with word timings for barely any of its lines
 * — or a tenth of the words another source found — is demoted a whole tier by [effectiveKind], so the
 * fragment protection is intact and lives where preferences cannot reach it.
