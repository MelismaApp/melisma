/**
 * Everything extra a Spotify token can buy, over and above the lyrics.
 *
 * A media session gives us a track title, an artist name and a small bitmap. With the same
 * `sp_dc`-derived token the lyrics provider already uses, three better things become
 * available:
 *
 * - the **artist image**, which is what Spicy Lyrics' "Artist Header" background is,
 * - the **full-resolution album cover** (640 px, against the 200–300 px thumbnail most
 *   players publish), which the background and the Cinema view both look better for,
 * - the **audio analysis** — tempo and loudness — which lets the drifting background move
 *   in time with the song rather than at a fixed rate.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort. No token, no request; a failed request just means the
 * app carries on with what the media session gave it.
