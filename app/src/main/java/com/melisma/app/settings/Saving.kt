 * What the app is giving up right now to save power.
 *
 * Three separate answers rather than one "saving" flag, because each measure costs something
 * different and the trade is not the same for everybody: a still background is barely noticeable,
 * a screen that dims mid-song is the app failing at its job. The system's battery saver is the
 * trigger; these say what it is allowed to do.
 *
 * Computed rather than stored, so there is one place that decides and it can be tested without a
 * phone in a low-battery state.
