## What it does

🎤 **Word-by-word karaoke**, not a scrolling teleprompter — each syllable fills as it is sung, lifts,
swells and glows, and a note held over a second breaks into individually animated letters.

🎧 **Follows any player.** It reads the media session Android makes every audio app publish, so
there is nothing to connect and no service to log into.

🈶 **Romanization and furigana** for Japanese (through a real dictionary, so kanji get the right
reading), Chinese, Korean, Cyrillic and Greek — per syllable, so the karaoke fill still works, and
per *script*, so a song that switches language mid-line is romanized throughout rather than halfway.
Taiwanese Hokkien songs are recognised and read in Tâi-lô or POJ rather than pinyin.

🌍 **Translation on the device** via ML Kit. The lyrics never leave your phone.

🪟 **Popup lyrics** in a floating window over other apps, plus **Cinema** view with the album art
beside the words, and a **compact**, **minimal** and **simple** mode.

🎨 **Living background** drawn from the album art — Spicy Lyrics' own renderer, ported — paced by
the song's tempo. Or Spotify's **Canvas** video, full or blurred, on tracks that have one (blurred
only in the car).

📋 **Copy a line** by holding it, or pick out several and copy them together.

🚗 **Android Auto** — the same renderer on the car screen, moving words and all, following every
setting on your phone so there is nothing to change from the driver's seat. With a watch-the-road
reminder each drive, and a plain two-line mode if the animation pulls at your eyes.
[docs/ANDROID-AUTO.md](docs/ANDROID-AUTO.md).

🔋 **Stops when the music does.** Nothing animates, nothing polls, and after ten idle minutes the app
lets go of everything keeping it alive.

<details>
<summary>The rendering, in detail</summary>

A port of Spicy Lyrics' visual language, down to the curve constants:

- Each syllable is filled by a soft gradient sweeping down through it as it is sung, while it lifts,
  swells past its resting size, and glows.
- A syllable held for over a second breaks into **individually animated letters**, so a held note
  ripples instead of sitting bright.
- Every other line is drawn as a **blur of itself**, with the radius growing the further it is from
  the current line. That is what gives the page its depth.
- Instrumental gaps of three seconds or more become **three dots** that breathe in turn.
- Duet lines pin to the opposite edge; backing vocals render smaller under their lead.
- Sung lines fade out rather than snapping back, so a breath between lines reads as one.
- Scrolling is spring-driven and hands control back to you the moment you drag.
- Songwriters and the lyrics source close the song, inside the scroll rather than in the chrome.
- Backgrounds: **Living**, **Living (classic)** (the older drifting colour field), **Auto**,
  **Cover art** with a blur slider, **Artist**, **Colour**, **Black** — and **Spotify Canvas** over
  any of them, which falls back to your chosen style on tracks without a video.

## Install

1. **Download the APK** from the [latest release](https://github.com/MelismaApp/melisma/releases/latest)
   and install it. Android will warn you about installing outside the Play Store; that is expected for
   any APK.
2. **Open it and tap "Open notification access"**, then enable Melisma in the list that appears
   and come back. It picks the permission up on its own.
3. **Play something.** Lyrics appear.

That is the whole setup. Android 10 or newer.

## Using it

| | |
|---|---|
| **Tap a line** | Jumps the song to it |
| **Hold a line** | Copies it |
| **Drag** | Scrolls freely; the lyrics take back over a moment after you let go |
| **Copy button** | Pick out several lines, then copy those or all of them |
| **Views** | *Lyrics* fills the screen; *Cinema* puts the album art, scrubber and transport beside the words; *Popup* floats over other apps and shrinks into place when you leave, like YouTube |

**The one setting most people end up wanting is *Sync offset*.** Players and audio routes add their
own latency. If the highlight reaches a word *before* you hear it, go negative — and **Bluetooth
earbuds always need a negative value**, because they run 150–250 ms behind what the player reports.

Every setting has a one-line description, and the **?** in the settings header expands a longer
explanation under each one. There is also a welcome guide in *Settings → About*.

## Where the lyrics come from

Every enabled source is asked **at once**, and then: word-by-word beats line-by-line beats unsynced,
most of a song beats a scrap of one, and **after that your order decides**. Hold a row's handle in
*Settings → Where lyrics come from* and drag it — moving a source up really does change which lyrics
you get, for every song where two sources answer equally well.

"Word-by-word" is checked rather than taken on trust, because a source can claim it and not mean it.
A line whose every word arrives in one block is line timing however it is labelled — which is what
Musixmatch returns for a lot of Chinese and Japanese — and timings that run past the end of the track
belong to some other recording. Either one drops a source a rank for that song, so a source that
really is word-timed wins even if you put it last.

| Source | Timing | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Your own files** | up to word | `.lrc` / `.ttml` you import. Always wins. |
| **AMLL TTML Database** | **word** | **Nothing.** Community-timed, hand-made, public domain. |
| **NetEase Cloud Music** | **word** | **Nothing.** Best for Japanese, Korean and Chinese — ships hand-checked romanization and translation. |
| **Musixmatch** | **word** | **Nothing.** Most Western music. |
| **LRCLIB** | line | **Nothing.** Open community database. |
| **Spotify** | line | An access token — see [tokens](#optional-tokens). |
| **Apple Music** | **word** | Two tokens. The best data there is: official romanizations and translations. |
| **Your own cache server** | any | Optional, for putting one server in front of the free ones — [CACHE-SERVER.md](docs/CACHE-SERVER.md). |

**Four sources need no account at all** — the four in the middle — and they are the ones switched on
when you install it. The rest are there for the tracks the free ones miss.

## Optional tokens

Skip this unless something is missing. Pasting your own credentials adds:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Spotify** | Its own lyrics, the cover at full size, the artist's image, and the song's tempo |
| **Apple Music** | Word-by-word lyrics with official romanizations and translations |
| **Musixmatch / NetEase** | Higher rate limits and a wider catalogue |

They are read out of a browser session you are already signed in to — there is no Melisma
account and no server in between. They stay in the app's private storage and each is sent only to the
service it belongs to.

**→ [docs/TOKENS.md](docs/TOKENS.md) has step-by-step instructions for every one of them**, including
how to stop having to replace the Spotify token every hour.

A source with nothing to authenticate with is skipped rather than queried, so leaving one enabled
while you go and find its token costs nothing.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why | What leaves your phone |
|---|---|---|
| **Notification access** | The only way Android lets an app read another app's media session. The service that holds it ignores notifications entirely. | Nothing |
| **Internet**, network state | Looking lyrics up, and noticing when there is no connection to look with. | The track title, artist, album and duration, to the lyrics sources you have enabled |
| **Install packages** | Only when you press Install on an in-app update. On Android 12 and up it installs without Android's own confirmation screen when Android allows it, and shows that screen when not. Only an update signed with the release key installs. | Nothing |

There is no analytics, no crash reporting and no account. Lyrics are cached on the device for 30
days and nowhere else.

## FAQ

**Do I need Spotify Premium, or a Spotify account?**

No. The app reads what your phone is playing, whatever is playing it. It never talks to Spotify unless
you paste a token yourself.

**Does it work with YouTube Music / SoundCloud / a local player?**

Yes — anything that publishes a media session, which is everything that plays audio on Android. You
can also switch a player off under *Settings → Players to follow*, which is how you stop a podcast or
a video being looked up as a song.

**Why does it want notification access? That sounds like a lot.**

Because it is the only way Android will let an app read another app's playback position. The service
that holds the permission has an empty `onNotificationPosted` — it never reads a notification. It is
also released automatically after ten idle minutes.

**Is it on the Play Store / F-Droid?**

No. Install the APK from [releases](https://github.com/MelismaApp/melisma/releases/latest);
the app checks GitHub for updates itself and offers to install them.

**Why is the APK 34 MB?**

The Japanese dictionary and the offline translation engine are nearly all of it. Both are the price of
getting kanji readings right and of translating without sending your lyrics anywhere.

**Lyrics are slightly out of time.**

*Settings → Timing → Sync offset.* Negative for Bluetooth. See [above](#using-it).

**Does it work with Android Auto?**

Yes, and it is the real thing: the same renderer the phone draws, with the syllable fill, the
background and the album art in Cinema view, following the settings you already set. The car's own
buttons handle play and skip, because nothing on the drawn surface can be tapped. There is a
watch-the-road reminder each drive, and *Settings → Android Auto* has a plain two-line mode.

You do have to turn on **Unknown sources** in Android Auto's own developer settings first, because
Melisma is not on Google Play and never can be for cars: the Car App Library has seven app categories
and none of them is lyrics. [docs/ANDROID-AUTO.md](docs/ANDROID-AUTO.md) has the five steps and the
reasoning.

**Can I move my settings to a new phone?**

*Settings → Storage and backup → Back up settings to a file.* You choose where the file goes. It is
plain readable JSON by default; tick **Include your tokens** and your credentials go in as well,
encrypted under a passphrase you choose. Restoring is the row underneath, and anything the file does
not mention is left as it is.

**A track has no lyrics, or the wrong ones.**

*Settings → This track → Look this track up again* forces a fresh lookup. If nothing has it, you can
import a `.lrc` or `.ttml` file yourself, and that always wins.

## Building it

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug      # debug APK
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease    # release APK (unsigned without a keystore)
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest  # unit tests
```

Needs the Android SDK (platform 36) and a JDK 17+. A fresh clone never needs anybody's signing key.

## The name

A **melisma** is one syllable sung across several notes — the held note that ripples instead of
sitting still. It is the thing this app draws letter by letter, and it is what a lyric sheet cannot
show you.

(Formerly *Better Lyrics*, renamed because [another project](https://github.com/better-lyrics/better-lyrics)
had the name first and does something different with it.)
